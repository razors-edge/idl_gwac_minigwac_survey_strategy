night time: the sun is located 10 degrees below horizon 
observable area: altitude is higher than 30 degrees;
				avoid the area of low galactic latitude (20 degrees);
				Moonphase and moondistance
				
				

fix mosaic of all sky 

priority: long time range, large nearby galaxies quantity, eastward

to do: observation time in a year for each frame.

pro list:
sky_area_mosaic_minigwac.pro   The program devides all sky into the fix mosaic according to the FOV 
of mini-GWAC
hour_angle_elevation_minigwac_xinglong.pro: 
				This pro calculates the observable areas for GWAC during the night. 
				The night time of one specific day is defined as the time when the sun is located 
				lower than 10 degrees below horizon. Each time point of 30 minutes in the whole day is calculated 
				for the sun position. The solar zenith angle is calculated by the "zenith" fanction;
				The local sidereal time for each time point is calculated by the "local_sidereal_time" 
				program. The night time (observing time) is also defined here.
				
				Calculate the angular distance between the local sidereal time of each time point and 
				the center of each grid. The grids with angular distance less than 62 degrees and the galaxtic latitude higher
				than 20 degrees are observable at the specific time point.
				
				Calculate earlist observing time point for each specific grid.
				
				Calculate the earlist time point and the lastest time point for each specific grid when this grid is observable (Calculate the 
				observing time range for each specific grid).
				
				Calculate the Moon phase, Moon position and angular distance between the Moon and each grid. 
				
				Write the coordinates of observable grids, the begin and end local sidereal time, the begin and end Beijing time, the Moon positions 
				at begin and end time points and the Moon phase into a output text file.

minigwac_observing_area_time.pro:
				plot the observable grids and the begin and end Beijing time into a figure. The areas are seperated according to their dec (-20, 20, 60),
				so the telescopes can select specific dec to observe. 
				
minigwac_observing_area_list.pro:
				Calculate the observation list and plot

minigwac_observing_area_dark.pro:
				make a observation list for dark mode.
								
minigwac_observing_area_total_night.pro:
				make a total list of the night including the calibration observations and parking
							
minigwac_star_number_sum.pro:
				statistic of star number of MiniGWAC FOV

survey_widget_tool_test.pro: GUI tool for user (test version)
